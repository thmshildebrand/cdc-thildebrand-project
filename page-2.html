        <h4>Cafe de Casa and WhatsApp Business</h4>
        <p>Favorite features and how these features have helped the business to grow, engage or attract more customers: Definitely the catalog and the labels. Although most part of customers still donâ€™t know they can access the catalog at the store icon on the top right of the screen (95% of them ask us for the menu), it helps us a lot to display all items at once, with pictures and prices. Another feature we love but not all of them make a good use of it is the shopping cart. 
        </p>
        <p class="panel">
          Cafe de Casa always catered for numerous events, since big weddings, birthday parties to corporate lunches. People used to call our locations for catering orders, but sometimes we could face some issues like customers showing up at a different location or date or not sure about what they ordered on the phone.
As latins, English is not our first language, and sometimes speaking on the phone, in the middle of a busy day, with blenders, printers, coffee grinders around, can be hard for the clients to hear us and for our staff to understand and get all the information needed.

          Once we decided to start using WhatsApp Business, at the beginning of the year, we were able to reduce the â€˜noiseâ€™ and we had all the information there, as written proof of what people order, to when and where to pick it up. The use of the app also facilitated when charging the customers, now we can send their invoice links on the chat and with few taps, they can open and pay for their orders.
